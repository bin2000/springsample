# springsample

A Spring Boot sample app to show github actions workflows.

Run locally with Gradle wrapper (Windows):

```powershell
./gradlew.bat clean build
./gradlew.bat bootRun
```

Or on Unix/macOS:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew bootRun
```

The app serves `Hello World!` at http://localhost:8080/.
